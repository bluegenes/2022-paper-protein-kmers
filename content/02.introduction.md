## Background

As the scale of genomic sequencing continues to grow, alignment-free methods for estimating sequence similarity have become critical for conducting tasks ranging from taxonomic classification to phylogenetic analysis on large-scale datasets [@doi:10.1186/s13059-016-0997-x; @doi:10.1186/gb-2014-15-3-r46].
The majority of alignment-free methods rely upon exact matching of k-mers: subsequences of length k, that can be counted and compared across datasets, with or without use of subsampling methods such as MinHash [@doi:10.1186/s13059-016-0997-x] and derivates such as FracMinHash [@doi:10.1101/2022.01.11.475838].
As k-mer based methods rely on exact sequence matches, they can suffer from limited sensitivity when comparing highly polymorphic sequences or classifying organisms from groups that are not well represented in reference databases.

Current best practices methods can still only categorize a fraction of the metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data, especially for understudied and/or diverse habitats (xx% recovery for soil, xx% recovery ocean metagenomes, etc).
Even well-studied environments such as human gut can produce significant uncharacterized metagenome content.
"For example, a reference-based approach failed to map 35% of reads in the iHMP study on inflammatory bowel disease (Supp. Data. of (Franzosa et al., 2019)), omitting them from any further analysis.
These reads may belong to unknown microbes, phage or viruses, plasmids, or accessory elements of known microbes, all of which can
play a role in disease.[from RO1]".
To increase sensitivity of alignment-free methods, modified k-mer approaches have been introduced, including spaced seeds /split k-mers, which accommodate polymorphic sites in highly similar genomes [].
For larger evolutionary distances, protein-based comparisons have long been the gold-standard approach for taxonomic and functional annotation, as protein sequence is more conserved than the underlying DNA sequence [@pubmed:2231712; @doi:10.1038/nmeth.3176]. 

**Taxonomic Classification section**
BLASTX-style classification --> proteins increase sensitivity.
_notes:_
- Kaiju[@doi:10.1038/ncomms11257] uses protein-level metagenomic classification using 6-frame translation, though Kaiju uses a seed-extend approach to generate protein alignments (minimum match length 11aa), rather than a purely k-mer based approach.
- sensitivity/specificity tradeoff -- longer matches (minimum match length 11 instead of 12 for MEM yielded larger gains in sensitivity for a relatively small(er) loss in precision).
- MEGAN-Prot (uses DIAMOND) [@doi:10.1002/cpz1.59] uses a BLASTX style approach
- review incl. protein methods [@doi:10.1093/bib/bbx120]

As microbial and viral genomes are gene-dense, [MinHash-based] alignment-free comparisons of translated protein sequence have already been shown to increase sensitivity for taxonomic classification and genome discovery [@doi:10.1038/ncomms11257; @doi:10.1186/s13059-019-1841-x].
Here, we demonstrate the utility of protein k-mer comparisons for phylogenomic reconstruction and taxonomic classification at larger evolutionary distances.
We use FracMinhash subsampling to facilitate conducting these comparisons at scale and increase accuracy relative to MinHash methods [@doi:10.1101/2022.01.11.475838].

FracMinHash is a MinHash variant for selecting and hashing a set of representative k-mers from a sequence dataset [@doi:10.1101/2022.01.11.475838]. Unlike traditional MinHash, FracMinHash sketches scale with the size of the dataset, meaning each sketch is comprised of the chosen fraction of k-mers in the input dataset, rather than a chosen number of k-mers.
Downsampling sequencing datasets in this way enables estimation of containment, which has been shown to permit more accurate estimation of genomic distance, particularly for genomes of very different lengths [@doi:10.1016/j.amc.2019.02.018; @doi:10.1186/s13059-019-1875-0].
Streaming containment estimates have been shown to facilitate genome discovery and correlate with Mash Distance, a proxy for Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-019-1841-x; @doi:10.1186/s13059-020-02159-0].

Standardized genomic measures of relatedness such as ANI and its protein counterpart, Average Amino Acid Identity (AAI) have shown lasting utility for genome relatedness and phylogenomic analysis.
Traditional ANI and AAI describe the sequence similarity of all orthologous genes, either in nucleotide or protein space, respectively.
Both have been shown to be robust measures of overall pairwise genome relatedness even for highly incomplete datasets, such as those comprised of only ~4% of the genome or 100 genes [@doi:10.1128/AEM.01398-06; @doi:10.1038/ismej.2017.113].
ANI has emerged as the most widely-accepted method for estimating pairwise similarity of microbial genomes and delimiting species boundaries [@doi:10.1073/pnas.0906412106].
Recent research appears to confirm 95% ANI species threshold for prokaryotic species, although there is some debate as to the universality of this threshold [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-07641-9; @doi:10.1128/mSystems.00731-19; @doi:10.1101/2020.07.27.223511].
AAI thresholds have been proposed for higher taxonomic ranks, <45%, 45-65% and 65-95% for family, genus, and species [@doi:10.1016/j.mib.2007.08.006; @doi:10.1038/ismej.2017.113].
While traditional alignment-based estimation of ANI and AAI are computationally intensive, sketching-based estimates and sketching-facilitated estimates have permitted ANI calculations at the scale of whole-databases [@doi:10.1186/s13059-016-0997-x; @doi:10.1186/s13059-019-1841-x; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-07641-9].
Hera et. al (2022) [@doi:10.1101/2022.01.11.475870] introduced accurate nucleotide sequence distance estimation from FracMinHash containment estimates, while accounting for the non-independence of mutated k-mers [@doi:10.1101/2021.01.15.426881].


Here, we show that protein FracMinHash sketches can be used to find similarity across larger evolutionary distances than nucleotide k-mers. We demonstrate that FracMinHash Containment estimates can robustly estimate Average Amino Acid Identity across a range of evolutionary distances.
We then use FracMinHash comparison methods to tackle two classification challenges: taxonomic classification of assembled genomes, and compositional analysis of metagenomes.
Taken together, these results suggest that protein FracMinHash analyses can be used for metagenome sequence analysis, and may be particularly useful when sequenced organisms are more distantly related to organisms available in reference databases.

 , using genomes within the GTDB taxonomy as benchmarking test set.

We extend FracMinHash distance estimation to protein k-mers and demonstrate distance estimation across related genomes using the GTDB taxonomy.
FracMinHash containment estimates work well for genome pairs of varying lengths and for compositional analysis of metagenome samples.

FracMinHash sketches can be used for robust assembly and alignment-free pairwise relatedness estimation that can be used on sequences separated by a wide range of evolutionary distances.

Here, we demonstrate that the utility of FracMinHash protein containment, both used directly and a an approximation of ANI and AAI, for taxonomic classification and phylogenomic reconstruction for species across the tree of life.
