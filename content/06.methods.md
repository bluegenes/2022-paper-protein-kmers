## Methods

### Scaled MinHash Sketching with Sourmash

As implemented in sourmash [@https://dib-lab.github.io/2020-paper-sourmash-gather; @doi:10.12688/f1000research.19675.1; @doi:10.21105/joss.00027], Scaled MinHash is a MinHash variant that uses a scaling factor to subsample the unique k-mers in the dataset to the chosen proportion (1/`scaled`).
As k-mers are randomized prior to systematic subsampling, Scaled MinHash sketches are representative subsets that can be used for comparisons, as long as the k-mer size and chosen scaled value remain consistent. 
Unlike traditional MinHash sketches, Scaled MinHash sketches enable similarity estimation with containment, which permits more accurate estimation of genomic distance when genomes or datasets differ in size [@doi:10.1016/j.amc.2019.02.018;@doi:10.1186/s13059-019-1875-0]. 

Sourmash v4.x supports sketching from either nucleotide or protein input sequence.
All genome sequences were sketched with sourmash v4.0 using the `sourmash sketch dna` command, k-mer sizes of 21,31,51, a scaling factor of 1000. 
Sourmash also supports 6-frame translation of nucleotide sequence to amino acid sequence.
To assess the utility of these translated sketches, genome sequences were also sketched with the `sourmash sketch translate` command at protein k-sizes (_kaa-mer sizes?_) of 7-12 and a scaling factor of 100. 
All proteome sequences were sketched with sourmash v4.0 using the `sourmash sketch protein` command at protein k-sizes (_kaa-mer sizes?_) of 7-12 and a scaling factor of 100.
Where higher scaling factors were evaluated, these original sketches were downsampled using the sourmash `downsample` method prior to conducting sequence similarity comparisons.


### Sequence Identity Estimation from Scaled MinHash
_(very DRAFTy)_

Sourmash contains standard implementations of Jaccard Index [@doi:10.1186/s13059-016-0997-x] and Containment Index [@doi:10.1016/j.amc.2019.02.018] set comparisons.

**Estimating Sequence Similarity from Jaccard**
For a comparison between two genomes (genomeA, genomeB), the Jaccard Index represents the k-mers shared between the two genomes (sketch intersection) divided by the k-mers present in both sketches (sketch union).
Thus the Jaccard Index represents the percent of shared k-mers relative to all k-mers across both genomes (intersection/genomeA+genomeB).
MinHash Sketch Jaccard has been shown to correlate well with ANI at high sequence identities (>=90% sequence identity) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-016-0997-x]; (>=80% sequence identity [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-07641-9].

**Mash Distance from Scaled MinHash Jaccard**

_TBD_



**Estimating Sequence Similarity from Containment**
As the Jaccard Index utilizes the union of all k-mers in a dataset, it is greatly affected by differences in dataset size [@doi:10.1093/bib/bbz083].
The Containment Index instead represents the percent of a genome found in the comparison genome.
Containment is directional: while the number of shared k-mers is fixed for a pairwise comparison, the Containment of each dataset will depend on the unique k-mers found in that particular dataset. Containment for genomeA will be (intersection/genomeA), while Containment for genomeB will be (intersection/genomeB).

Alignment-based ANI represents the sequence similarity of the alignable fraction of two genomes. In this way, ANI only compares the shared sequences, and discounts/ignores all other sequence present in either genome.
Bidirectional containment comparisons use the same numerator (shared k-mers), but may contain different numbers of non-shared k-mers in the denominator.

In cases where both genomes are high-quality and highly complete, we can most closely approximate ANI by using the maximum value between the bidirectional containment values: that is, using the comparison that represents the shared sequence over the genome with the smallest number of non-shared k-mers.

In cases where one genome is more trusted (high quality and highly complete), Containment may be best calculated relative to the trusted genome.
This use case also allows us to estimate sequence identity from larger sequence collections, such as metagenomes.
By definition, metagenomes contain k-mers from many organisms.
We can take advantage of directional Containment by calculating the Containment Index of Reference genomes that share many k-mers with the Metagenome.
We have already shown the utility of Containment for metagenome classification [@https://dib-lab.github.io/2020-paper-sourmash-gather], but now we can report estimated average sequence identity between the matching sequence regions and the reference genome.

**Estimating Sequence Identity from Scaled MinHash**

**_TBD_**

Blanca et al, 2021 [@doi:10.1101/2021.01.15.426881] presented a method to estimate the mutation rate between MinHash sketches while accounting for the non-independence of mutated k-mers. Using [@https://github.com/KoslickiLab/mutation-rate-ci-calculator], we estimate Sequence Identity from Scaled MinHash Containment.

Estimating sequence similarity from Scaled MinHash requires a good estimate of the number of unique k-mers in the sketched sequencing dataset [@https://github.com/dib-lab/sourmash/pull/1270]...







### Scaled MinHash Distance Correlates with Standard Methods

FastANI v1.32 ([@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-07641-9]; run with default parameters)  was used to obtain Average Nucleotide Identity between the anchor genome and each additional genome in its evolutionary path.
FastANI is targeted at ANI values between 80%-100%, so only values in this range are considered "trusted" and used in **assessing the correlation between Scaled MinHash estimates and FastANI._(TBD)_**

CompareM v0.1.2 ([@url:https://github.com/dparks1134/CompareM]; run with `--sensitive` parameter for DIAMOND mapping) was used to obtain Average Amino Acid Identity between the anchor proteome and each additional proteome in its evolutionary path.
CompareM reports the mean and standard deviation of AAI, as well as the fraction of orthologous genes upon which this estimate is based.
Briefly, CompareM calls genes for each genome or proteome using PRODIGAL [@doi:10.1038/nmeth.3176] and conducts reciprocal best-hit mapping via DIAMOND [@doi:10.1186/1471-2105-11-119].
By default, CompareM requires at least 30% percent sequence identity and 70% percent alignment length to identify orthologous genes.
As DIAMOND alignment-based homology identification may correlate less well with BLAST-based homology under 60% sequence identity [@url:https://rodriguez-r.com/blog/aai-blast-vs-diamond/], **we also ran compareM with a percent sequence identity threshold of 60% to obtain a set of high-confidence orthologous genes for AAI estimation. We report correlation between Scaled MinHash AAI estimation and each of these compareM parameter sets in XX _(TBD)_**. _CompareM was also used to obtain AAI values directly from each genome, using PRODIGAL to translate sequences prior to gene calling. These results [were not significantly different from proteome-based AAI estimation??] (Supplemental XX)._


### Taxonomic Classification with Sourmash `Gather` and `Taxonomy`

To take advantage of the increased evolutionary distance comparisons offered by protein k-mers, we apply compositional analysis with sourmash gather [@https://dib-lab.github.io/2020-paper-sourmash-gather] to protein sequences (amino acid input and 6-frame translation from nucleotides).
Sourmash gather is conducted in two parts: 
First (preselection), gather searches the query against all reference genomes, building all genomes with matches into a smaller, in-memory database for use in step 2.
Second (decomposition), gather does iterative best-containment decomposition, where query k-mers are iteratively assigned to the reference genome with best containment match.
In this way, gather reports the minimal list of reference genomes that contain all of the k-mers that matched any reference in the database.

For reference matches with high sequence identity (ANI) to the query, we classify the query sequence as a member of the reference taxonomic group, as in [@https://dib-lab.github.io/2020-paper-sourmash-gather].
**However, when ANI between the query and the top reference match exceeds the taxonomic rank threshold (e.g. species default 95%), we use a least/lowest common ancestor (LCA) approach to report likely taxonomy at a higher taxonomic rank _(TBD)_**.
Briefly, as gather reports non-overlapping genome matches, we can sum the k-mer matches for all genomes with shared taxonomies at the next higher taxonomic rank to report the best query containment at that rank.
As this gather-LCA approach first uniquely assigns k-mers to their best reference genome, it bypasses the impact of increasing database size on taxonomic assignment observed for other LCA-based k-mer classification approaches [@doi:10.1186/s13059-018-1554-6].
