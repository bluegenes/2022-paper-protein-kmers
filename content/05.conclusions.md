## Conclusions

Containment-based pairwise distance estimation via Scaled Minhash enables accurate assembly-free and alignment-free phylogenomic reconstruction and taxonomic classification across a wide range of evolutionary distances.

While here we have focused on demonstrating utility of amino acid k-mers for global proteome similarity, the correlation of unique amino acid 10-mers with genes should enable gene-level analyses, if sketching with sufficient k-mers.
