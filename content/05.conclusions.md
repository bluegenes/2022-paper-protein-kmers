## Conclusions

Protein search has long been used for comparisons conducted at increased evolutionary distances.
Using genomes from the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB) we showcase the utility of amino acid k~aa~-mer comparisons for alignment-free and assembly-free proteome similarity estimation and taxonomic classification.
Subsampling k~aa~mers using FracMinHash sketching makes global protein similarity assessment tractable for the current scale of sequencing.


<!--
Containment-based pairwise distance estimation via FracMinhash enables accurate alignment-free and assembly-free phylogenomic reconstruction and taxonomic classification across a wide range of evolutionary distances.
While here we have focused on demonstrating utility of amino acid k-mers for global proteome similarity, the correlation of unique amino acid 10-mers with genes should enable gene-level analyses, if sketching with sufficient k-mers.
FracMinHash $cAAI$ enables fast and low-memory AAI estimation, allowing whole-proteome comparisons across entire databases, including hundreds of thousands of comparisons.
