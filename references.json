Whole-genome similarity metrics such as Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) help address this question by facilitating high resolution taxonomic analysis of thousands of genomes from diverse phylogenetic lineages. To scale to available genomes and beyond, we present FastANI, a new method to estimate ANI using alignment-free approximate sequence mapping. FastANI is accurate for both finished and draft genomes, and is up to three orders of magnitude faster compared to alignment-based approaches. We leverage FastANI to compute pairwise ANI values among all prokaryotic genomes available in the NCBI database. Our results reveal clear genetic discontinuity, with 99.8% of the total 8 billion genome pairs analyzed conforming to >95% intra-species and <83% inter-species ANI values. This discontinuity is manifested with or without the most frequently sequenced species, and is robust to historic additions in the genome databases.",

This vast amount of data has enabled researchers to study relations between a variety of genomic and epigenomic features, including genetic variation, gene regulation and phenotypic traits. Such relations are typically investigated by comparatively assessing genomic co-occurrence. Technically, this corresponds to assessing the similarity of pairs of genome-wide binary vectors. A variety of similarity measures have been proposed for this problem in other fields like ecology. However, while several of these measures have been employed for assessing genomic co-occurrence, their appropriateness for the genomic setting has never been investigated. We show that the choice of similarity measure may strongly influence results and propose two alternative modelling assumptions that can be used to guide this choice. On both simulated and real genomic data, the Jaccard index is strongly altered by dataset size and should be used with caution. The Forbes coefficient (fold change) and tetrachoric correlation are less influenced by dataset size, but one should be aware of increased variance for small datasets.\r\n            All results on simulated and real data can be inspected and reproduced at https://hyperbrowser.uio.no/sim-measure.",

Researchers commonly need to build computational workflows that include multiple analytic tools and require incremental development as experimental insights demand tool and parameter modifications. These workflows can produce hundreds to thousands of intermediate files and results that must be integrated for biological insight. Data-centric workflow systems that internally manage computational resources, software, and conditional execution of analysis steps are reshaping the landscape of biological data analysis and empowering researchers to conduct reproducible analyses at scale. Adoption of these tools can facilitate and expedite robust data analysis, but knowledge of these techniques is still lacking. Here, we provide a series of strategies for leveraging workflow systems with structured project, data, and resource management to streamline large-scale biological analysis. We present these practices in the context of high-throughput sequencing data analysis, but the principles are broadly applicable to biologists working beyond this field.",

Here, we consider the simple model where a sequence S (e.g. a genome or a read) undergoes a simple mutation process whereby each nucleotide is mutated independently with some probability r, under the assumption that there are no spurious k-mer matches. How does this process affect the k-mers of S? We derive the expectation and variance of the number of mutated k-mers and of the number of islands (a maximal interval of mutated k-mers) and oceans (a maximal interval of non-mutated k-mers). We then derive hypothesis tests and confidence intervals for r given an observed number of mutated k-mers, or, alternatively, given the Jaccard similarity (with or without minhash). We demonstrate the usefulness of our results using a few select applications: obtaining a confidence interval to supplement the Mash distance point estimate, filtering out reads during alignment by Minimap2, and rating long read alignments to a de Bruijn graph by Jabba.",

Of the approximately 10 million animal species predicted to exist on Earth, >99.9% do not have any submitted genome assembly.

Here we describe two algorithms for compositional analysis of metagenome sequencing data. We first investigate the FracMinHash sketching technique, a derivative of modulo hash that supports Jaccard containment estimation between sets of different sizes. We implement FracMinHash in the sourmash software, evaluate its accuracy, and demonstrate large-scale containment searches of metagenomes using 700,000 microbial reference genomes. We next frame shotgun metagenome compositional analysis as the problem of finding a minimum collection of reference genomes that “cover” the known k-mers in a metagenome, a minimum set cover problem. We implement a greedy approximate solution using FracMinHash sketches, and evaluate its accuracy for taxonomic assignment using a CAMI community benchmark. Finally, we show that the minimum metagenome cover can be used to guide the selection of reference genomes for read mapping. sourmash is available as open source software under the BSD 3-Clause license at\r\n            github.com/dib-lab/sourmash/\r\n            .",

    "abstract": "Abstract\r\n          \r\n            Sketching methods offer computational biologists scalable techniques to analyze data sets that continue to grow in size. MinHash is one such technique that has enjoyed recent broad application. However, traditional MinHash has previously been shown to perform poorly when applied to sets of very dissimilar sizes.\r\n            FracMinHash\r\n            was recently introduced as a modification of MinHash to compensate for this lack of performance when set sizes differ. While experimental evidence has been encouraging, FracMinHash has not yet been analyzed from a theoretical perspective. In this paper, we perform such an analysis and prove that while FracMinHash is not unbiased, this bias is easily corrected. Next, we detail how a simple mutation model interacts with FracMinHash and are able to derive confidence intervals for evolutionary mutation distances between pairs of sequences as well as hypothesis tests for FracMinHash. We find that FracMinHash estimates the containment of a genome in a large metagenome more accurately and more precisely when compared to traditional MinHash, and the confidence interval performs significantly better in estimating mutation distances. A python-based implementation of the theorems we derive is freely available at\r\n            https://github.com/KoslickiLab/mutation-rate-ci-calculator\r\n            .

Sketching approaches entice with improved scalability but also carry the danger of decreased accuracy and added bias. In this paper, we investigate the minimizer sketch and its use to estimate the Jaccard similarity between two sequences.\r\n          \r\n          \r\n            Results\r\n            \r\n              We show that the minimizer Jaccard estimator is\r\n              biased\r\n              and\r\n              inconsistent\r\n              , which means that the expected difference (i.e., the bias) between the estimator and the true value is not zero, even in the limit as the lengths of the sequences grow. We derive an analytical formula for the bias as a function of how the shared\r\n              k\r\n              -mers are laid out along the sequences. We show both theoretically and empirically that there are families of sequences where the bias can be substantial (e.g. the true Jaccard can be more than double the estimate).

The higher information content in long reads is useful for a variety of metagenomics analyses, including taxonomic profiling. The development of long-read specific tools for taxonomic profiling is accelerating, yet there is a lack of consensus regarding their relative performance. Here, we perform a critical benchmarking study using five long-read methods and four popular short-read methods. We applied these tools to several mock community datasets generated using Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) HiFi or Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) sequencing, and evaluated their performance based on read utilization, detection metrics, and relative abundance estimates. Our results show that long-read methods generally outperformed short-read methods. Short-read methods (including Kraken2, Bracken, Centrifuge, and MetaPhlAn3) produced many false positives (particularly at lower abundances), required heavy filtering to achieve acceptable precision (at the cost of reduced recall), and produced inaccurate abundance estimates. By contrast, several long-read methods displayed very high precision and acceptable recall without any filtering required, including BugSeq, MEGAN-LR using translation alignments (DIAMOND to NCBI nr) or nucleotide alignments (minimap2 to NCBI nt). Furthermore, in the PacBio HiFi datasets these long-read methods detected all species down to the 0.1% abundance level with high precision. Other long-read methods, such as MetaMaps and MMseqs2, required moderate filtering to reduce false positives to achieve a suitable balance between precision and recall. We found read quality affected performance for methods relying on protein prediction or exact kmer matching, and these methods performed better with PacBio HiFi datasets. We also found that long-read datasets with a large proportion of shorter reads (<2kb length) resulted in lower precision and worse abundance estimates, relative to length-filtered datasets. Finally, for a given mock community we found that the long-read datasets produced significantly better results than short-read datasets, demonstrating clear advantages for long-read metagenomic sequencing. Our critical assessment of available methods provides recommendations for current research using long reads and establishes a baseline for future benchmarking studies.",

It\r\nremains unclear, however, how the results based on a few genes in the\r\ngenome correlate with whole-genome-based relatedness and what genes (if\r\nany) best reflect whole-genome-level relatedness and hence should be\r\npreferentially used to economize on cost and to improve accuracy. We\r\nshow here that phylogenies of closely related organisms based on the\r\naverage nucleotide identity (ANI) of their shared genes correspond\r\naccurately to phylogenies based on state-of-the-art analysis of their\r\nwhole-genome sequences. We use ANI to evaluate the phylogenetic\r\nrobustness of every gene in the genome and show that almost all core\r\ngenes, regardless of their functions and positions in the genome, offer\r\nrobust phylogenetic reconstruction among strains that show 80 to 95%\r\nANI (16S rRNA identity, >98.5%). Lack of elapsed time and, to a\r\nlesser extent, horizontal transfer and recombination make the selection\r\nof genes more critical for applications that target the intraspecies\r\nlevel, i.e., strains that show >95% ANI according to current\r\nstandards. A much more accurate phylogeny for the\r\n              Escherichia\r\ncoli\r\n              group was obtained based on just three best-performing genes\r\naccording to our analysis compared to the concatenated alignment of\r\neight genes that are commonly employed for phylogenetic purposes in\r\nthis group. Our results are reproducible within the\r\n              Salmonella\r\n              ,\r\n              Burkholderia\r\n              , and\r\n              Shewanella\r\n              groups and therefore are expected to have general applicability for\r\nmicroevolution studies, including metagenomic\r\nsurveys.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\r\n            Current-day metagenomics analyses increasingly involve de novo taxonomic classification of long DNA sequences and metagenome-assembled genomes. Here, we show that the conventional best-hit approach often leads to classifications that are too specific, especially when the sequences represent novel deep lineages. We present a classification method that integrates multiple signals to classify sequences (Contig Annotation Tool, CAT) and metagenome-assembled genomes (Bin Annotation Tool, BAT). Classifications are automatically made at low taxonomic ranks if closely related organisms are present in the reference database and at higher ranks otherwise. The result is a high classification precision even for sequences from considerably unknown organisms.",

However, this method cannot reliably estimate the containment of a genome within a metagenome. Here, we describe an online algorithm capable of measuring the containment of genomes and proteomes within either assembled or unassembled sequencing read sets. We describe several use cases, including contamination screening and retrospective analysis of metagenomes for novel genome discovery. Using this tool, we provide containment estimates for every NCBI RefSeq genome within every SRA metagenome and demonstrate the identification of a novel polyomavirus species from a public metagenome.",

    "abstract": "Data analysis often entails a multitude of heterogeneous steps, from the application of various command line tools to the usage of scripting languages like R or Python for the generation of plots and tables. It is widely recognized that data analyses should ideally be conducted in a reproducible way. Reproducibility enables technical validation and regeneration of results on the original or even new data. However, reproducibility alone is by no means sufficient to deliver an analysis that is of lasting impact (i.e., sustainable) for the field, or even just one research group. We postulate that it is equally important to ensure adaptability and transparency. The former describes the ability to modify the analysis to answer extended or slightly different research questions. The latter describes the ability to understand the analysis in order to judge whether it is not only technically, but methodologically valid.\r\n            Here, we analyze the properties needed for a data analysis to become reproducible, adaptable, and transparent. We show how the popular workflow management system Snakemake can be used to guarantee this, and how it enables an ergonomic, combined, unified representation of all steps involved in data analysis, ranging from raw data processing, to quality control and fine-grained, interactive exploration and plotting of final results.",

In the context of the human microbiome, this is important for establishing links between microbial species and disease states. Here we benchmark the Microba Community Profiler (MCP) against other metagenomic classifiers using 140 moderate to complex\r\n              in silico\r\n              microbial communities and a standardized reference genome database. MCP generated accurate relative abundance estimates and made substantially fewer false positive predictions than other classifiers while retaining a high recall rate. We further demonstrated that the accuracy of species classification was substantially increased using the Microba Genome Database, which is more comprehensive than reference datasets used by other classifiers and illustrates the importance of including genomes of uncultured taxa in reference databases. Consequently, MCP classifies appreciably more reads than other classifiers when using their recommended reference databases. These results establish MCP as best-in-class with the ability to produce comprehensive and accurate species profiles of human gastrointestinal samples.",

    "abstract": "A new approach to rapid sequence comparison, basic local alignment search tool (BLAST), directly approximates alignments that optimize a measure of local similarity, the maximal segment pair (MSP) score. Recent mathematical results on the stochastic properties of MSP scores allow an analysis of the performance of this method as well as the statistical significance of alignments it generates. The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straightforward DNA and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long DNA sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability to mathematical analysis, BLAST is an order of magnitude faster than existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.",
