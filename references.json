Whole-genome similarity metrics such as Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) help address this question by facilitating high resolution taxonomic analysis of thousands of genomes from diverse phylogenetic lineages. To scale to available genomes and beyond, we present FastANI, a new method to estimate ANI using alignment-free approximate sequence mapping. FastANI is accurate for both finished and draft genomes, and is up to three orders of magnitude faster compared to alignment-based approaches. We leverage FastANI to compute pairwise ANI values among all prokaryotic genomes available in the NCBI database. Our results reveal clear genetic discontinuity, with 99.8% of the total 8 billion genome pairs analyzed conforming to >95% intra-species and <83% inter-species ANI values. This discontinuity is manifested with or without the most frequently sequenced species, and is robust to historic additions in the genome databases.",

Here, we survey two of the primary types of methods for analyzing microbiome data: read classification and metagenomic assembly, and we review some of the challenges facing these methods. All of the methods rely on public genome databases, and we also discuss the content of these databases and how their quality has a direct impact on our ability to interpret a microbiome sample.",

This vast amount of data has enabled researchers to study relations between a variety of genomic and epigenomic features, including genetic variation, gene regulation and phenotypic traits. Such relations are typically investigated by comparatively assessing genomic co-occurrence. Technically, this corresponds to assessing the similarity of pairs of genome-wide binary vectors. A variety of similarity measures have been proposed for this problem in other fields like ecology. However, while several of these measures have been employed for assessing genomic co-occurrence, their appropriateness for the genomic setting has never been investigated. We show that the choice of similarity measure may strongly influence results and propose two alternative modelling assumptions that can be used to guide this choice. On both simulated and real genomic data, the Jaccard index is strongly altered by dataset size and should be used with caution. The Forbes coefficient (fold change) and tetrachoric correlation are less influenced by dataset size, but one should be aware of increased variance for small datasets.\r\n            All results on simulated and real data can be inspected and reproduced at https://hyperbrowser.uio.no/sim-measure.",

Researchers commonly need to build computational workflows that include multiple analytic tools and require incremental development as experimental insights demand tool and parameter modifications. These workflows can produce hundreds to thousands of intermediate files and results that must be integrated for biological insight. Data-centric workflow systems that internally manage computational resources, software, and conditional execution of analysis steps are reshaping the landscape of biological data analysis and empowering researchers to conduct reproducible analyses at scale. Adoption of these tools can facilitate and expedite robust data analysis, but knowledge of these techniques is still lacking. Here, we provide a series of strategies for leveraging workflow systems with structured project, data, and resource management to streamline large-scale biological analysis. We present these practices in the context of high-throughput sequencing data analysis, but the principles are broadly applicable to biologists working beyond this field.",

    "abstract": "In prokaryotic taxonomy, a set of criteria is commonly used to delineate species. These criteria are generally based on cohesion at the phylogenetic, phenotypic and genomic levels. One such criterion shown to have promise in the genomic era is average nucleotide identity (ANI), which provides an average measure of similarity across homologous regions shared by a pair of genomes. However, despite the popularity and relative ease of using this metric, ANI has undergone numerous refinements, with variations in genome fragmentation, homologue detection parameters and search algorithms. To test the robustness of a 95–96 % species cut-off range across all the commonly used ANI approaches, seven different methods were used to calculate ANI values for intra- and interspecies datasets representing three classes in the\r\n              \r\n                \r\n                  Proteobacteria\r\n                \r\n              \r\n              . As a reference point, these methods were all compared to the widely used\r\n              blast\r\n              -based ANI (i.e. ANIb as implemented in JSpecies), and regression analyses were performed to investigate the correlation of these methods to ANIb with more than 130000 individual data points. From these analyses, it was clear that ANI methods did not provide consistent results regarding the conspecificity of isolates. Most of the methods investigated did not correlate perfectly with ANIb, particularly between 90 and 100% identity, which includes the proposed species boundary. There was also a difference in the correlation of methods for the different taxon sets. Our study thus suggests that the specific approach employed needs to be considered when ANI is used to delineate prokaryotic species. We furthermore suggest that one would first need to determine an appropriate cut-off value for a specific taxon set, based on the intraspecific diversity of that group, before conclusions on conspecificity of isolates can be made, and that the resulting species hypotheses be confirmed with analyses based on evolutionary history as part of the polyphasic approach to taxonomy.",

Here, we consider the simple model where a sequence S (e.g. a genome or a read) undergoes a simple mutation process whereby each nucleotide is mutated independently with some probability r, under the assumption that there are no spurious k-mer matches. How does this process affect the k-mers of S? We derive the expectation and variance of the number of mutated k-mers and of the number of islands (a maximal interval of mutated k-mers) and oceans (a maximal interval of non-mutated k-mers). We then derive hypothesis tests and confidence intervals for r given an observed number of mutated k-mers, or, alternatively, given the Jaccard similarity (with or without minhash). We demonstrate the usefulness of our results using a few select applications: obtaining a confidence interval to supplement the Mash distance point estimate, filtering out reads during alignment by Minimap2, and rating long read alignments to a de Bruijn graph by Jabba.",

Of the approximately 10 million animal species predicted to exist on Earth, >99.9% do not have any submitted genome assembly. To enable scRNA-seq for the vast majority of animals on the planet, here we introduce the concept of “\r\n            k\r\n            -mer homology,” combining biochemical synonyms in degenerate protein alphabets with uniform data subsampling via MinHash into a pipeline called\r\n            Kmermaid\r\n            . Implementing this pipeline enables direct detection of similar cell types across species from transcriptomic data without the need for a reference genome. Underpinning\r\n            Kmermaid\r\n            is the tool\r\n            Orpheum\r\n            , a memory-efficient method for extracting high-confidence protein-coding sequences from RNA-seq data.

Our pipeline provides a high-throughput tool that enables analyses of transcriptomic data across divergent species’ transcriptomes in a genome- and gene annotation-agnostic manner. Thus, the combination of\r\n            Kmermaid\r\n            and\r\n            Orpheum\r\n            identifies cell type-specific sequences that may be missing from genome annotations and empowers molecular cellular phenotyping for novel model organisms and species.",

Here we describe two algorithms for compositional analysis of metagenome sequencing data. We first investigate the FracMinHash sketching technique, a derivative of modulo hash that supports Jaccard containment estimation between sets of different sizes. We implement FracMinHash in the sourmash software, evaluate its accuracy, and demonstrate large-scale containment searches of metagenomes using 700,000 microbial reference genomes. We next frame shotgun metagenome compositional analysis as the problem of finding a minimum collection of reference genomes that “cover” the known k-mers in a metagenome, a minimum set cover problem. We implement a greedy approximate solution using FracMinHash sketches, and evaluate its accuracy for taxonomic assignment using a CAMI community benchmark. Finally, we show that the minimum metagenome cover can be used to guide the selection of reference genomes for read mapping. sourmash is available as open source software under the BSD 3-Clause license at\r\n            github.com/dib-lab/sourmash/\r\n            .",

MinHash is one such technique that has enjoyed recent broad application. However, traditional MinHash has previously been shown to perform poorly when applied to sets of very dissimilar sizes.\r\n            FracMinHash\r\n            was recently introduced as a modification of MinHash to compensate for this lack of performance when set sizes differ. While experimental evidence has been encouraging, FracMinHash has not yet been analyzed from a theoretical perspective. In this paper, we perform such an analysis and prove that while FracMinHash is not unbiased, this bias is easily corrected. Next, we detail how a simple mutation model interacts with FracMinHash and are able to derive confidence intervals for evolutionary mutation distances between pairs of sequences as well as hypothesis tests for FracMinHash. We find that FracMinHash estimates the containment of a genome in a large metagenome more accurately and more precisely when compared to traditional MinHash, and the confidence interval performs significantly better in estimating mutation distances.

The higher information content in long reads is useful for a variety of metagenomics analyses, including taxonomic profiling. The development of long-read specific tools for taxonomic profiling is accelerating, yet there is a lack of consensus regarding their relative performance. Here, we perform a critical benchmarking study using five long-read methods and four popular short-read methods. We applied these tools to several mock community datasets generated using Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) HiFi or Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) sequencing, and evaluated their performance based on read utilization, detection metrics, and relative abundance estimates. Our results show that long-read methods generally outperformed short-read methods. Short-read methods (including Kraken2, Bracken, Centrifuge, and MetaPhlAn3) produced many false positives (particularly at lower abundances), required heavy filtering to achieve acceptable precision (at the cost of reduced recall), and produced inaccurate abundance estimates. By contrast, several long-read methods displayed very high precision and acceptable recall without any filtering required, including BugSeq, MEGAN-LR using translation alignments (DIAMOND to NCBI nr) or nucleotide alignments (minimap2 to NCBI nt). Furthermore, in the PacBio HiFi datasets these long-read methods detected all species down to the 0.1% abundance level with high precision. Other long-read methods, such as MetaMaps and MMseqs2, required moderate filtering to reduce false positives to achieve a suitable balance between precision and recall. We found read quality affected performance for methods relying on protein prediction or exact kmer matching, and these methods performed better with PacBio HiFi datasets. We also found that long-read datasets with a large proportion of shorter reads (<2kb length) resulted in lower precision and worse abundance estimates, relative to length-filtered datasets. Finally, for a given mock community we found that the long-read datasets produced significantly better results than short-read datasets, demonstrating clear advantages for long-read metagenomic sequencing. Our critical assessment of available methods provides recommendations for current research using long reads and establishes a baseline for future benchmarking studies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\r\n          \r\n            An estimated 2 billion species of microbes exist on Earth with orders of magnitude more strains. Microbial pangenomes are created by aggregating all genomes of a single clade and reflect the metabolic diversity of groups of organisms. As\r\n            de novo\r\n            metagenome analysis techniques have matured and reference genome databases have expanded, metapangenome analysis has risen in popularity as a tool to organize the functional potential of organisms in relation to the environment from which those organisms were sampled. However, the reliance on assembly and binning or on reference databases often leaves substantial portions of metagenomes unanalyzed, thereby underestimating the functional potential of a community. To address this challenge, we present a method for metapangenomics that relies on amino acid k-mers (k\r\n            aa\r\n            -mers) and metagenome assembly graph queries. To enable this method, we first show that k\r\n            aa\r\n            -mers estimate pangenome characteristics and that open reading frames can be accurately predicted from short shotgun sequencing reads using the previously developed tool orpheum. These techniques enable pangenomics to be performed directly on short sequencing reads. To enable metapangenome analysis, we combine these approaches with compact de Bruijn assembly graph queries to directly generate sets of sequencing reads for a specific species from a metagenome. When applied to stool metagenomes from an individual receiving antibiotics over time, we show that these approaches identify strain fluctuations that coincide with antibiotic exposure.",

It\r\nremains unclear, however, how the results based on a few genes in the\r\ngenome correlate with whole-genome-based relatedness and what genes (if\r\nany) best reflect whole-genome-level relatedness and hence should be\r\npreferentially used to economize on cost and to improve accuracy. We\r\nshow here that phylogenies of closely related organisms based on the\r\naverage nucleotide identity (ANI) of their shared genes correspond\r\naccurately to phylogenies based on state-of-the-art analysis of their\r\nwhole-genome sequences. We use ANI to evaluate the phylogenetic\r\nrobustness of every gene in the genome and show that almost all core\r\ngenes, regardless of their functions and positions in the genome, offer\r\nrobust phylogenetic reconstruction among strains that show 80 to 95%\r\nANI (16S rRNA identity, >98.5%). Lack of elapsed time and, to a\r\nlesser extent, horizontal transfer and recombination make the selection\r\nof genes more critical for applications that target the intraspecies\r\nlevel, i.e., strains that show >95% ANI according to current\r\nstandards. A much more accurate phylogeny for the\r\n              Escherichia\r\ncoli\r\n              group was obtained based on just three best-performing genes\r\naccording to our analysis compared to the concatenated alignment of\r\neight genes that are commonly employed for phylogenetic purposes in\r\nthis group. Our results are reproducible within the\r\n              Salmonella\r\n              ,\r\n              Burkholderia\r\n              , and\r\n              Shewanella\r\n              groups and therefore are expected to have general applicability for\r\nmicroevolution studies, including metagenomic\r\nsurveys.",

We present the algorithm MetaPalette, which uses long\r\n              k\r\n              -mer sizes (\r\n              k\r\n              = 30, 50) to fit a\r\n              k\r\n              -mer “palette” of a given sample to the\r\n              k\r\n              -mer palette of reference organisms. By modeling the\r\n              k\r\n              -mer palettes of unknown organisms, the method also gives an indication of the presence, abundance, and evolutionary relatedness of novel organisms present in the sample. The method returns a traditional, fixed-rank taxonomic profile which is shown on independently simulated data to be one of the most accurate to date. Tree figures are also returned that quantify the relatedness of novel organisms to reference sequences, and the accuracy of such figures is demonstrated on simulated spike-ins and a metagenomic soil sample.

We present a classification method that integrates multiple signals to classify sequences (Contig Annotation Tool, CAT) and metagenome-assembled genomes (Bin Annotation Tool, BAT). Classifications are automatically made at low taxonomic ranks if closely related organisms are present in the reference database and at higher ranks otherwise. The result is a high classification precision even for sequences from considerably unknown organisms.",

    "abstract": "Recently developed MinHash-based techniques were proven successful in quickly estimating the level of similarity between large nucleotide sequences. This article discusses their usage and limitations in practice to approximating uncorrected distances between genomes, and transforming these pairwise dissimilarities into proper evolutionary distances. It is notably shown that complex distance measures can be easily approximated using simple transformation formulae based on few parameters. MinHash-based techniques can therefore be very useful for implementing fast yet accurate alignment-free phylogenetic reconstruction procedures from large sets of genomes. This last point of view is assessed with a simulation study using a dedicated bioinformatics tool.",

    "abstract": "Data analysis often entails a multitude of heterogeneous steps, from the application of various command line tools to the usage of scripting languages like R or Python for the generation of plots and tables. It is widely recognized that data analyses should ideally be conducted in a reproducible way. Reproducibility enables technical validation and regeneration of results on the original or even new data. However, reproducibility alone is by no means sufficient to deliver an analysis that is of lasting impact (i.e., sustainable) for the field, or even just one research group. We postulate that it is equally important to ensure adaptability and transparency. The former describes the ability to modify the analysis to answer extended or slightly different research questions. The latter describes the ability to understand the analysis in order to judge whether it is not only technically, but methodologically valid.\r\n            Here, we analyze the properties needed for a data analysis to become reproducible, adaptable, and transparent. We show how the popular workflow management system Snakemake can be used to guarantee this, and how it enables an ergonomic, combined, unified representation of all steps involved in data analysis, ranging from raw data processing, to quality control and fine-grained, interactive exploration and plotting of final results.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\r\n          Estimation of whole-genome relatedness and taxonomic identification are two important bioinformatics tasks in describing environmental or clinical microbiomes. The genome-aggregate Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) is routinely used to derive the relatedness of closely related (species level) microbial and viral genomes, but it is not appropriate for more divergent genomes. Average Amino Acid Identity (AAI) can be used in the latter cases, but no current AAI implementation can efficiently compare thousands of genomes. Here we present FastAAI, a tool that estimates whole-genome pairwise relatedness using shared tetramers of universal proteins in a matter of microseconds, providing a speedup of up to 5 orders of magnitude when compared with current methods of calculating AAI or alternative whole-genome metrics. Further, FastAAI resolves distantly related genomes related at the phylum level with comparable accuracy to the phylogeny of ribosomal rRNA genes, substantially improving on a known limitation of current AAI implementations. Therefore, Fast AAI uniquely expands the toolbox for microbiome analysis and allows it to scale to millions of genomes.",

Recent mathematical results on the stochastic properties of MSP scores allow an analysis of the performance of this method as well as the statistical significance of alignments it generates. The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straightforward DNA and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long DNA sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability to mathematical analysis, BLAST is an order of magnitude faster than existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.",
